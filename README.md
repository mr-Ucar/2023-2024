The playlist "Sounds: How-To" is dedicated to helping you learn about mouth positions for each sound in American English. More advanced learners will also find the playlist "Words That Reduce" useful, as they can learn how native speakers shorten words when they talk.

2. **English with Jennifer**: This channel is a rich collection of hundreds of videos that are grouped into easy-to-use playlists.
